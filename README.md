# React + Redux Toolkit Counter App

A simple yet comprehensive counter application built with React and Redux Toolkit. This project serves as a hands-on guide to understanding the core concepts of modern Redux, including creating a store, defining slices with reducers, and connecting React components to the state using hooks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Concepts & Workflow

This project demonstrates a complete workflow for integrating Redux Toolkit into a React application.

### 1. Creating the Redux Store
The global state is managed in a single **store**, created using `configureStore` from `@reduxjs/toolkit`. It combines all feature-specific reducers.

### 2. Providing the Store to React
The `<Provider>` component from `react-redux` wraps the root `<App />` component, making the store available to the entire application.

### 3. Creating a Feature Slice (`counterSlice`)
The `createSlice` function organizes the state logic for a feature. It auto-generates action creators and includes:
-   **Initial State:** The starting state for the slice.
-   **Reducers:** Functions that define how the state can be updated (`increment`, `decrement`, `reset`, etc.).

### 4. Building the UI & Interaction
The UI is built with React components and styled with **Tailwind CSS**. Buttons dispatch actions via `onClick` handlers.

### 5. Connecting Components with Hooks
- **`useSelector`**: Reads data from the store.
- **`useDispatch`**: Sends actions to the store to trigger state updates.
- **`useRef`**: Manages the input field without causing unnecessary re-renders.
